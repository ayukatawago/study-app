# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a newly created repository named "study-app". The repository currently does not contain any code files or configuration files. It only has an initial commit.

## Development Setup

As the codebase develops, common commands for building, testing, and linting will be documented here.

## Architecture

The architecture of this application will be documented here as it develops.

## Note

This CLAUDE.md file is an initial version and should be updated as the codebase grows to include:

1. Commands for building, running, testing, and linting the application
2. High-level architectural patterns and code organization
3. Important workflows and development processes

When adding new functionality to the codebase, please update this file accordingly.
